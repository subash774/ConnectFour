# Connect Four
A simple game to learn the basics of Golang and revise algorithms such as minimax search and other search algorithms. 

# TODO:
- Implement minimax with variable depths for different difficulties 
- Turn the functions into API endpoints so the UI can be better looking
- Using API endpoints, make a web app game (Unlikely, I can't do frontend, please submit pull request xD)
